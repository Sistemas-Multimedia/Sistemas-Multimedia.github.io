\section{Methodology}
SM (Sistemas Multimedia) follows the PBL (Project-Based Learning)
methodology. The students, helped by the teacher, develop a project
during the course. This project is
\href{https://github.com/Sistemas-Multimedia/VCF}{VCF (Visual Coding Framework)}, a image/video
compression environment where to test the algorithms seen in theory. In the
\href{https://www.ual.es/estudios/masteres/presentacion/plandeestudios/asignatura/7114/71142105}{Teaching
  Guide} you can find the details about how to study the contents and
  the evaluation of the subject.

The project is described as a sequence of milestones (or topics), each
one with the following structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A description of the milestone. This part is worked in class.
\item A ``\emph{What do I have to do?}'' section, which describes the
  virtualized job of the students.
\item How much time you should spend working in the previous
  virtualized section.
\item The deliverables that you should generate and send to the
  teacher.
\item A list of bibliographic references.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Milestones}
A list of the current milestones is available in the
