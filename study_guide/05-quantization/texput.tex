\title{\SM{} - Study Guide - Milestone 5: Quantizing in the RGB Domain}

\maketitle

\section{Description}
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system}{Humans} are quite
efficient recognizing the information stored in images (and frames of
a video), even when this information has been degraded or (partially)
lost. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(signal_processing)}{Quantization}~\cite{sayood2017introduction,vetterli2014foundations}
is a technique that can remove the part of the visual information that
is less relevant for us, and implies
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression}{lossy coding},
which provides
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression_ratio}{compression
  ratios} at least one order of magnitude higher than using
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_compression}{lossless
  coding}.

In this milestone we are going to quantize a frame in the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model}{RGB color
  domain}. A
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(signal_processing)}{\textbf{quantizer}}
(typically denoted by $Q$) is a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression}{encoding system}
that inputs a sequence of (digital) samples $x$ and output a sequence
of quantization indexes $k$ (see the Fig.~\ref{fig:Q}). The inverse
system, called a \textbf{dequantizer} (and denoted by $Q^{-1}$),
recover an approximate version of $x$ that we will denote as
$\tilde{x}$, depending on the quantization step $\Delta$. Notice that
although $\Delta$ is an input parameter to the quantizer, it has not
been considered in the figure to keep it simpler. We define the
quantization error
\begin{equation}
  e_i = x_i - \tilde{x}_i,
\end{equation}
that obviously, should be minimized.

Quantizers can be classifies into:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Scalar quantizers}: those that produce a quantization
  index $k_i$ by each input sample $x_i$.
\item \textbf{Vector quantizers}: that process the input by blocks of
  samples, called vectors, producing a quantization index by vector,
  and usually, the length of the quantization index y much shorter
  than the length of the vector. Vector Quantization (VQ) can remove
  spatial correlation and therefore, are more efficient that Scalar
  Quantization (SQ). On the other hand, the computational requirements
  of VQ are, by far, higher than the needed by SQ. If we also consider
  that there are other techniques (such as transform coding) that are
  able to decorrelate the samples with less computation than VQ, we
  can understand why SQ has been selected, for example, in most
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_coding_format}{video
    codecs}.
\end{enumerate}

Quantizers, also, can be classified as:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Uniform quantizers}: those in which $\Delta$ is
  idependent on the amplitude of the samples.
\item \textbf{Non-unifom quantizers}, on the contrary, when $\Delta$
  depends (directly or indirectly) on the amplitude of the samples.
\end{enumerate}

Non-uniform quantizers can be:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Static quantizers}: if $\Delta$ depends on the amplitude
  of the samples (as happens, for example, in
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companding}{companded
    quantizers}), but this dependency is known \emph{a-priori}.
\item \textbf{Adaptive quantizers}: when $\Delta$ is adapted to
  minimize the quantization error, depending ``on-the-fly'' on the
  characteristics\footnote{Depending, for example, on the
    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function}{PDF}
    of the signal.} of the signal.
\end{enumerate}

All quantizers can be classified into:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Mid-tread quantizers}, if $\tilde{x}_i$ can be $0$.
\item \textbf{Mid-rised quantizers}, if $\tilde{x}_i$ never is $0$,
  even if $x_i=0$.
\end{enumerate}

Finally, quantizers can be classified as:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Dead-zone quantizers}, that are characterized by a
  quantization step of length $2\Delta$ for $x_i=0$. Deadzone
  quantizers tends to remove the
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(electronics)}{electronic
    noise} (that usually has an small amplitude compared to the input
  signal $x$). Notice that dead-zone quantizers should not be
  consdered uniform, and that all dead-zone quantizers, by definition,
  are mid-tread.
\item \textbf{No dead-zone quantizers}, when the dead-zone does not
  exist.
\end{enumerate}

behaviour of 3 different quantizers.  Use this

\section{What you have to do?}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Please, modify this
  \href{https://github.com/Sistemas-Multimedia/Sistemas-Multimedia.github.io/blob/master/study_guide/05-quantization/performance.ipynb}{notebook}
  in order to use the
  \href{https://docs.opencv.org/master/d4/da8/group__imgcodecs.html}{TIFF
    and JPEG 2000 image formats} instead of PNG. Compare the RD
  curves.
\item In the previous
  \href{https://github.com/Sistemas-Multimedia/Sistemas-Multimedia.github.io/blob/master/study_guide/05-quantization/performance.ipynb}{notebook}
  the three color channels, R, G, and B has been quantized using the
  same quantization step
  ($\Delta_{\text{R}} = \Delta_{\text{G}} = \Delta_{\text{B}}$). Do
  you think that this strategy minimizes the quantization error?
\item Compare the estimation provided by the entropy with the
  DEFLATE's bit-rates.
