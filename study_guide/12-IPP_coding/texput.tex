\section{Description}

\subsection{The IPP... decorrelation pattern}
It's time to put together all the tools that we have developed for
encoding a sequence of frames. We will call to this set of images, a
Group Of Frames (GOF), and the structure of each GOP will be IPP...,
which means that the first frame of each GOF will be intra-coded
(I-type), and the rest of frames of the GOF will be predicted-coded
(P-type). Notice that in a I-type frame all the coefficients will be
I-type, and in a P-type frame, the different coefficients can be
I-type or P-type.

\subsection{Multiresolution iterations}
In each IPP... iteration, only a sequence of $[H]$ subbands is
decorrelated considering the information provided by the $[L]$
subbands. Therefore, in order to increase the CR, a minimum number of
IPP... iterations should be carried out. The number of iterations
controls the number of SRLs (Spatial Resolution Levels) $S$ generated,
where
\begin{equation}
  S = \text{the number of IPP... iterations} + 1.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Scalability}
It's easy to see that IPP...-type MRVC sequences are scalable in
resolution (R), and that Quality (Q) scalability in each SRL can be
achieved for the $[H]$ data\footnote{The $[L]$ must be always decoded
with the quality that the encoder used.} by simply using a
quality-scalable frame codec such as JPEG2000 for compressing the
coefficients. However, notice that the only allowed data progression
is RQ (first the quality is incremented and then, the resolution).

Let's suppose a compression where $\text{SRLs}= 

To provide, for example, a QR progression (reconstruct first by
quality and then, by resolution)
