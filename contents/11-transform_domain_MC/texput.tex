\maketitle

\tableofcontents

\section{Description}

In this milestone we will discuss the characteristics of the motion
estimation and compensation of frames
in the transform domain.



\subsection{The lack of shift-invariance in the DWT domain}
\section{What do I have to do?}

Please, implement Eq.~\ref{eq:output}, preferiblely in a Jupyter
notebook. Use the moving circle generator (see
this \href{https://github.com/Sistemas-Multimedia/Sistemas-Multimedia.github.io/blob/master/milestones/11-MC_in_DWT_domain/DWT_shift_invariance.ipynb}{notebook})
to create the video. Verify also Eq.~\ref{eq:crs}.

\section{Timming}

In groups, you will present the results for this milestone during the
exam time.

\section{Deliverables}

The notebook(s) and the presentation.
