\section{ Tight Laplacian Pyramid Transform (TLPT)}

Pyramid frames were introduced in 1983 by Burt and Adelson. In some
way, they can be considered one of the precursors of the wavelet
octave band decompositions.

Technically, the LPT is a frame expansion, that generates an expanded
octave-band decomposition. The ratio of redundancy in the
decomposition $R\rightarrow 2$ with the number of levels.

Because the shift invariance, MC can be incorporated in the enhancememt layer.

The LP with orthogonal filter is a tight frame.

\section{Critially Sampled LPT (CS-LPT)}

Technically, the LPT is a frame expansion, that generates an expanded
octave-band decomposition. The ratio of redundancy in the
decomposition $R\rightarrow 2$ with the number of DWT levels.

The 2D-DWT can a used on sequences of images, by simply iterating as
it is described in the Algorithm~\ref{alg:MDWT}. $I$ is the number of
images in the sequence $V$.

\begin{pseudocode}{\text{MDWT}}{V}
  \label{alg:MDWT}
  \FOR i \GETS 0 \TO I-1 \DO
  V_i = \text{2D-DWT}(V_i)
\end{pseudocode}

\section{Autoencoder Latent Representation}

In ANN-based image compression, an autoencoder can be used to find the latent representation of an (input) image. The compressor is the first part of the autoencoder and the decompressor is the second part. During the compression, the latent representation is quantized and entropy compressed.
