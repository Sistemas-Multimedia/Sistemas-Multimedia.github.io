\section{Spatial decorrelation}

Spatial transforms used in image and video compression exploit the
statistical (and also perceptual\footnote{We will see this later in
this course.}) correlation that the pixels show as a consequence of
the spatial correlation. For example, some areas of an image can occur
more than once, and usually, neighbor pixels tend to have similar
values.

Spatial transforms are image-wise operators. This means that the
transform inputs an image of pixels and output a matrix of
coefficients, which generally express the resemblance between the
image and a set of basis function. For example, after using the DCT,
each (index) coefficient represents a different frequency and its
value, the amount of the corresponding basis found in the image.

\section{Benefits of spatial transforms}

Spatial transforms provide:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Energy concentration:} A small set of (usually low-frequency) coefficients (usually) represents most of the information (energy) of the image. This decreases the entropy and increases the range of the quantization step sizes, because the dynamic range of the coefficients is higher than the dynamic range of the pixels.
\item \textbf{Low/High frequency analysis:} Our visual system is more sensitive to the low frequencies (for this reason, the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_(vision)#Contrast_sensitivity}{contrast sensitiviy function} is not flat.
\item \textbf{Multiresolution:} Depending on the transform, it is possible to reconstruct the original image by resolution levels.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Scalar quantization and rate/distortion optimization}

Scalar quantization is efficient in the transform domain because the
coefficients are decorrelated. The next logical step (after
quantization) is the entropy coding of the quantization indexes. Here,
depending on how the coefficients are quantized we can trace different
RD curves (all of them starting (and finising) in the same
distortion). For example, if we compress each subband independently,
we must find the quantization step sizes that select the same slope in
the RD curve of each subband.

\section{To-Do}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Modify VCF to use the block-based DCT in the compression pipeline. Complexity 3.
%\item Modify CVF to use SPIHT.
\end{enumerate}

\section{ Tight Laplacian Pyramid Transform (TLPT)}

Pyramid frames were introduced in 1983 by Burt and Adelson. In some
way, they can be considered one of the precursors of the wavelet
octave band decompositions.

Technically, the LPT is a frame expansion, that generates an expanded
octave-band decomposition. The ratio of redundancy in the
decomposition $R\rightarrow 2$ with the number of levels.

Because the shift invariance, MC can be incorporated in the enhancememt layer.

The LP with orthogonal filter is a tight frame.

\section{Critially Sampled LPT (CS-LPT)}

Technically, the LPT is a frame expansion, that generates an expanded
octave-band decomposition. The ratio of redundancy in the
decomposition $R\rightarrow 2$ with the number of DWT levels.

The 2D-DWT can a used on sequences of images, by simply iterating as
it is described in the Algorithm~\ref{alg:MDWT}. $I$ is the number of
images in the sequence $V$.

\begin{pseudocode}{\text{MDWT}}{V}
  \label{alg:MDWT}
  \FOR i \GETS 0 \TO I-1 \DO
  V_i = \text{2D-DWT}(V_i)
\end{pseudocode}

\section{Autoencoder Latent Representation}
% Johannes Ball√©, Valero Laparra, and Eero P. Simoncelli. 2017. End-to-end Optimized Image Compression. In 5th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2017, Toulon, France, April 24-26, 2017

In ANN-based image compression, an autoencoder can be used to find the latent representation of an (input) image. The compressor is the first part of the autoencoder and the decompressor is the second part. During the compression, the latent representation is quantized and entropy compressed.
