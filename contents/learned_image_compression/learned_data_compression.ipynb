    "This notebook shows how to do lossy data compression using neural networks and [TensorFlow Compression](https://github.com/tensorflow/compression).\n",

    "Lossy compression involves making a trade-off between **rate**, the expected number of bits needed to encode a sample, and **distortion**, the expected error in the reconstruction of the sample.\n",

    "More background on learned data compression can be found in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03034) targeted at people familiar with classical data compression, or [this survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06533) targeted at a machine learning audience.\n"
