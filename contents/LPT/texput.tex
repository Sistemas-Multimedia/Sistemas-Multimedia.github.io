\title{\SM{} - Study Guide - Milestone 9: The Tight Laplacian Pyramid Transform (TLPT)}

\maketitle

Pyramid frames were introduced in 1983 by Burt and Adelson. In some
way, they can be considered one of the precursors of the wavelet
octave band decompositions.

Technically, the LPT is a frame expansion, that generates an expanded
octave-band decomposition. The ratio of redundancy in the
decomposition $R\rightarrow 2$ with the number of levels.

Because the shift invariance, MC can be incorporated in the enhance,emt layer.

The LP with orthogonal filter is a tight frame.
