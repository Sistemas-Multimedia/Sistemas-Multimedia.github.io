\section{About the Operating System}

\subsection{Running/Developing CVF ``Natively''}
The \href{https://github.com/Sistemas-Multimedia/VCF}{VCF project} has
been designed to work
in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux}{Linux}. Said that, it is
also possible to run CVF in other operating systems (OS) such as OSX
and Windows. Python and Git, the two main tools that we will use are
available in all these OSs. In the case of Linux, you can use your
prefered distribution.

This is the prefered option from a pure computational point of view.

\subsection{Running/Developing CVF in a Linux Container}
The second most efficient option in terms of computational
requirements and speed is to run Linux in a linux container, such
as the provided by \href{https://linuxcontainers.org/}{Docker}
(example for Ubuntu)
or \href{https://linuxcontainers.org/}{LXD}. Notice however, that you
should be able to run graphicsl applications (such
as \href{https://linuxcontainers.org/}{ImageMagick}
and \href{https://www.mozilla.org/firefox}{Firefox}) in your
container.

\subsection{Running/Developing CVF in a Linux Virtual Machine}
VCF works also in any Linux OS installed in a virtual machine (VM)
environment such as \href{https://www.virtualbox.org/}{Virtual Box},
\href{https://www.vmware.com/}{VMware} and \href{https://www.vmware.com/}{Parallels}.
The only drawback of this way of running CVF is that you will require
some extra memory and CPU power.

\subsection{Running CVF in a ``Notebook''}
Finally, it is possible to run CVF in any service able to run
``notebooks'', such
as \href{https://colab.research.google.com/}{Google Colaboratory}
or \href{https://mybinder.org/}{Binder}. Notice, however, that in this
case, you will probably need to configure your notebooks for
installing all the necessary stuff from the scratch if you use these
cloud services. If you opt for using Jupyter Notebook, this last
action is not necessary.

\section{About the Programing Language(s)}

VCF is written in \href{https://mybinder.org/}{Python}. You will need
also to interact with
a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface}{commands
line terminal}.

\section{About the Project Hosting Platform}

VCF is hosted at \href{https://github.com/}{GigHub}.
