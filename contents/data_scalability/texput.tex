\section{What means data scalability?}

\section{Quality scalability}

If we have used a layered-based encoding system and we know the RD
points generated by each layer of each subband, we can sort the points
by their slope and use the progression of layers to easely select hown
many quality layers should be used satisfiying some maximum distorion
of bit-rate. This is done, for example, in JPEG2000.
