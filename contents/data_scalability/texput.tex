\section{What means data scalability?}

\section{Temporal scalability using MCTF}

Is a special case of random-access mode in which the B-type frames
only contain B-type blocks and the reference frames are predetermined
using a dyadic pattern.

\section{Spatial scalability in video coding}

On the other hand, when the motion information is infered at the
decoder, this information will be less accurate that if we use all the
visual information available at the encoder.\footnote{The decoder, in
general, has a limited access to the original information because the
encoding system is lossy.}

\section{Quality scalability in image coding}

If we have used a layered-based encoding system and we know the RD
points generated by each layer of each subband, we can sort the points
by their slope and use the progression of layers to easely select hown
many quality layers should be used satisfiying some maximum distorion
of bit-rate. This is done, for example, in JPEG2000.

\section{Quality scalability in video coding}

\section{To-Do}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The $L$-levels DWT provides $L+1$ spatial resolution levels of
  an image. Modify the VCF pipeline to include this
  functionality. Complexity 2.
\item The $2^n\times 2^n$-DCT domain can be decoded by resolution
  levels using a inverse $2^m\times 2^m$-DCT where $m=0,1,\cdots,n$,
  to the lower frequency subbands (notice that the inverse
  $0\times 0$-DCT does not perform any computation). Implement in VCF
  such image decoder. Complexity 4.
\item In video coding, we can obtain spatial scalability if we build a
  laplacian pyramid of the frames and compress each level of the
  sequence using a normal video encoder. Notice that we can use the
  reconstructed sequence at the spatial level $l$ to improve the
  predictions for the level $l-1$. Incorporate this functionality to
  VCF. Complexity 6.
\item The spatial resolution level $l$ of the reconstructed video can
  be used (after interpolation) to estimate the motion at the $l-1$
  level, making the transmission of motion fields unnecessary for
  resolution level $l-1$. Explore this in VCF. Complexity 7.
\end{enumerate}
