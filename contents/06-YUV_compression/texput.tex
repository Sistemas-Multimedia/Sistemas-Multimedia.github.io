\section{Description}

\subsection{Components correlation}
%{{{

Usually, some part of the data in an image is
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_redundancy}{redundant} (can
be removed without loss of information). In the case of a color image
in the RGB domain, the three components of each pixel (each one
measuring the energy in a different band of the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum}{visible
  spectrum}) can be
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence}{correlated}.
\href{https://vicente-gonzalez-ruiz.github.io/transform_coding/}{Transform
  coding} applied between the color compoents can concentrate the
information (energy) of the image in a small set of coefficients, that
after quantization and entropy coding, can be compressed more
efficiently.\footnote{For example, if the energy of a color subband is
low, quantization could completely makes zero such subband, but the
reconstruction of the image would be reasonable. The most part of
entropy codecs (and of course, PNG's DEFLATE) reach higher compression
ratios with sequences of zeros.} This
\href{https://github.com/Sistemas-Multimedia/Sistemas-Multimedia.github.io/blob/master/milestones/06-YUV_compression/color_redundancy.ipynb}{notebook}
quantifies the redundancy related to the color domain.

\begin{comment}
To estimate the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(information_theory)}{redundancy}
we have basically two options:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)}{0-order
    (memoryless source) entropy} of the signal: the higher the
  entropy, the lower the redudancy. In fact, if we suppose that the
  samples of the signal are uncorrelated, the 0-order entropy is an
  exact measure of the expected bit-rate achieved by an
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_coding}{arithmetic
    encoder} (the most efficient entropy compressor). Unfortunately,
  the 0-order entropy is usually only a estimation of the redundancy,
  i.e., lower bit-rates can be achieved in practice after using a high-order
  decorrelation.
\item A better way is to use an
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression}{lossless
    compressor}: the higher the length of the compressed file compared
  to the length of the original file, the lower the
  redundancy.\footnote{If the length of the compressed file is equal or
  larger than the length of the original file, then, for the compressor
  that we are using, there is not redundancy in the original
  representation.} Notice, however, that although this estimation is
  more accurate than the 0-order entropy, in general, it depends on the
  compressor (different algoritms can provide different
  estimations).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Color spaces}
%{{{

The color of a pixel depends on the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum}{frequency of the
  light that the pixel captures}. Such information can be represented
in a number of different encoding systems known as
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space}{color spaces}. Among
all those systems, the RGB color space is the most used because it can
be obtained directly from the light signal using color
filters.\footnote{Specifically, a red filter, a green filter and a
blue filter.}

The RGB color model has evident physical advantages, but in general is
quite redundant. In this milestone we will analyze:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform}{DCT
    (Discrete Cosine Transform)} applied to the color domain, i.e.,
  the color-DCT space,
\item the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCbCr}{$\text{YCrCb}$} space, and
\item the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCoCg}{$\text{YCoCg}$} space,
\end{enumerate}
that are more efficient from a coding perspective. Besides,
$\text{YCrCb}$ and $\text{YCoCg}$ color spaces, which are
\emph{luma}-based (luminance-based\footnote{Luminance can be
considered as the intensity part of a viual stimuli.} color domains,
rely on the idea of separating the luminance coefficients (Y) from two
\emph{chroma} coefficients (red and blue in the case of
$\text{YCrCb}$, orange and green in the case of $\text{YCoCg}$). These
transformations have two main advantages~\cite{burger2016digital}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compatibility with legacy black and white systems is maintained
  while at the same time the bandwidth of the signal can be optimized
  by using diï¬€erent transmission bandwidths for the brightness and the
  chroma components.\footnote{Notice, however, that in the digital
  world bandwidth savings are equivalent to reduce the sampling rate.}
\item Since the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system}{HVS
  (Human Visual System)} is not able to perceive detail in the
  chrominance as well as it does in the luminance, the amount of
  information, and consequently
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)}{sampling
    rate}, used in the chrominance can be generally reduced to 1/4
  of the used for the luminance without a noticeable distortion (see
  Fig.~\ref{fig:san-diego_chroma_subsampled}). This
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)}{fact is
    used when compressing} digital still images and is one of the
  reason why, for example, the
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG}{JPEG} image compressor
  converts RGB images to $\text{YCrCb}$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The $\text{RGB}\Leftrightarrow\text{DCT}$ transform}
%{{{ 
The
3x3-\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform}{DCT}
orthonormal forward
\href{https://vicente-gonzalez-ruiz.github.io/transform_coding/}{transform}
is defined by

\begin{equation}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \text{DCT0} \\
    \text{DCT1} \\
    \text{DCT2}
  \end{bmatrix}
  =

    \text{R} \\
    \text{G} \\
    \text{B}

and the inverse transform by
\begin{equation}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \text{R} \\
    \text{G} \\
    \text{B}
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}

    \text{DCT0} \\
    \text{DCT1} \\
    \text{DCT2}

\end{equation}
See this
\href{https://github.com/Sistemas-Multimedia/Sistemas-Multimedia.github.io/blob/master/milestones/06-YUV_compression/color-DCT_matrix.ipynb}{notebook}
to see how to compute the filter's coefficients. Notice also that the
DCT is
\href{https://vicente-gonzalez-ruiz.github.io/transform_coding/}{orthonormal},
and therefore, the matrix of the forward transform is the transpose of the
matrix of the backward transform~\cite{sayood2017introduction}.

\begin{comment}
For example, the
2x2-\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karhunen-Loeve_theorem}{KLT}~\cite{sayood2017introduction}
is defined by
\begin{equation}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    {\mathbf{y}}_0 \\
    {\mathbf{y}}_1
  \end{bmatrix}
  = 
  \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    {\mathbf{x}}_0 \\
    {\mathbf{x}}_1
  \end{bmatrix},
  \label{eq:KLT_transform}
\end{equation}
and it holds that
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{K}={\mathbf{K}}^{-1}={\mathbf{K}}^{\text T},
  \label{eq:orthogonal_matrix}
\end{equation}
where ${\mathbf{K}}^{\text T}$ represents the transpose matrix of
$\mathbf{K}$.  Eq.~\ref{eq:orthogonal_matrix} is true for all
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality}{orthogonal}
transforms, and therefore
\begin{equation}
  \langle {\mathbf{K}}_i, {\mathbf{K}}_j\rangle = 0, \forall i\neq j.
\end{equation}
\end{comment}

\section{Quantization in the color-DCT domain}
The synthesis filters of orthonormal transforms are orthogonal (their
contributions to the reconstructed signal are independent) and have
exactly the unity gain.\footnote{The quantization error is the same in
all the subbands because all of them have exactly the same gain.}
Therefore, without considering that the entropy coding stage can
performs better for some subbands, the optimal quantization pattern
should be
\begin{equation}
  \Delta_{\text{DCT0}} = \Delta_{\text{DCT1}} = \Delta_{\text{DCT2}}.
\end{equation}
See this \href{https://github.com/Sistemas-Multimedia/Sistemas-Multimedia.github.io/blob/master/study_guide/06-color_transform/color-DCT_compression.ipynb}{notebook}.

%%%%%%%%%%%

Notice that to find the gains (of any 1D transform) we can compute the
energy of the signal generated by the inverse transform of the impulse
discrete 1D signal
\begin{equation}
  \delta_{i}(x) = 
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    1 & \text{if $i=x$}\\
    0 & \text{otherwise},
  \end{array}
  \right.
\end{equation}
where the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_(signal_processing)}{energy
  of a discrete signal} $x$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \langle x, x\rangle =  \sum_{i}{x_i^2}.
\end{equation}

If we consider that the RD curve can be affeced by the compresiblity of the subbands, a better solution to find the optimal RD curve is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Variying the $\Delta$, compute the RD curve for each DCT
  subband.
\item Sort the RD points (considering the three subbands at once), by
  their slope.
\item Apply progressively the combinations of quantization steps
  described by the sorted RD points.
\end{enumerate}
Notice that this algorithm is right because the DCT is orthogonal,
i.e., the contributions of the subbands to the reconstructe signal are
independent. See this \href{https://github.com/Sistemas-Multimedia/Sistemas-Multimedia.github.io/blob/master/study_guide/06-color_transform/color-DCT_compression.ipynb}{notebook}.

\subsection{The $\text{RGB} \Leftrightarrow \text{YCrCb}$ transform}
%\subsubsection{Analysis and synthesis}
To convert a (color) pixel from the $\text{RGB}$ domain into the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCbCr}{$\text{YCrCb}$} color
domain, we use the $\text{RGB/YCrCb}$ (analysis)
transform~\cite{malvar2008lifting}
%Eq.~\ref{eq:YCrCb}
%\href{https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/de/d25/imgproc_color_conversions.html}{can
%  be also written as}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{lcl}
    \text{Y}  & = & 0.299\text{R} + 0.587\text{G} + 0.114\text{B} \\
    \text{Cr} & = & 0.713(\text{R} - \text{Y}) + \delta \\
    \text{Cb} & = & 0.564(\text{B} - \text{Y}) + \delta,
  \end{array}
  \label{eq:alternative_YCrCb}
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{equation}
  \delta = \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    128 & \text{for 8 bits (unsigned) images},\\
    32768 & \text{for 16 bits (unsigned) images},\\
    0.5 & \text{for floating point (}[0,1]\text{) images}
  \end{array}
  \right.
\end{equation}
is used to avoid negative coefficients. As it can be seen, $\text{Cr}$
and $\text{Cb}$ are scaled versions of $\text{R} - \text{Y}$ and
$\text{B} - \text{Y}$, so $\text{Cr}$ and $\text{Cb}$ can be
interpreted as measures of how much red and blue content in a pixel
differs from luma, respectively. Notice also that for a gray pixel,
$\text{R}=\text{G}=\text{B}=\text{Y}$, and so
$\text{Cr}=\text{Cb}=0$~\cite{malvar2008lifting}.
\begin{comment}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \text{Y} \\
    \text{Cr} \\
    \text{Cb}
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0.299   &   0.587 & 0.114 \\ 
    0.5     & -0.4187 & -0.0813 \\
    -0.1687 & -0.3313 & 0.5
  \end{bmatrix}
  %\cdot
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \text{R} \\
    \text{G} \\
    \text{B}
  \end{bmatrix},
  \label{eq:YCrCb}
\end{equation}
\end{comment}
where $\text{Y}$ is the luma and $\text{CrCb}$ are the chromas. The
main reason for such mapping is that the HVS is much less sensitive to
the high-frequency information in the
chromas~\cite{burger2016digital}. Thus, as we mentioned above,
compression systems such as
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG}{JPEG} can
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downsampling_(signal_processing)}{downsample}
the chromas (usually by 2:1 in the horizontal and vertical
directions), as well as increase their quantization step sizes with
respect to the luma, to achieve further
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression_ratio}{compression}
without noticeable visual distortion~\cite{malvar2008lifting}.

As it can be seen, considering that the $\text{RGB}$ values ranges
between $0$ and $255$ (and rounding to the nearest integer),
$0\le\text{Y}\le 255$, $0\le\text{Cr}\le 255$ and
$0\le\text{Cb}\le 255$, and therefore, the number of bits that are
necessary to represent each $\text{YCrCb}$ component is 8 (although we
must use floating point arithmetic to perform the transform).

Finally, notice that the $\text{YCrCb}$ transform is not orthogonal
because the analysis filters are not independent. This can be seen in
the Eq.~\ref{eq:alternative_YCrCb}, where the $\text{Cr}$ coefficients
depend on the coefficients of $\text{Y}$, and therefore, there is a
dependency between both
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra)}{basis},
and something similar happens for the $\text{Cb}$ subband. This can
be also easely checked: $$0.299*0.5 + 0.587*(-0.4187) +
0.114*(-0.0813) = -0.1055451 \neq 0,$$ $$0.299*(-0.1687) +
0.587*(-0.3313) + 0.114*0.5 = -0.1879144 \neq
0,~\mathrm{and}$$ $$0.5*(-0.1687) + (-0.4187)*(-0.3313 ) +
(-0.0813)*0.5 = 0.01371531 \neq 0.$$

The inverse (synthesis) transform is defined by
\begin{comment}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \text{R} \\
    \text{G} \\
    \text{B}
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1  &  1.402  & 0 \\ 
    1  &  -0.714  &  -0.344 \\ 
    1  & 0  & 1.772
  \end{bmatrix}
  %\cdot
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \text{Y} \\
    \text{Cr} \\
    \text{Cb}
  \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
or alternatively, by
\end{comment}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{lcl}
    \text{R} & = & \text{Y} + 1.403(\text{Cr} - \delta) \\
    \text{G} & = & \text{Y} - 0.714(\text{Cr} - \delta) - 0.344(\text{Cb} - \delta)\\
    \text{B} & = & \text{Y} + 1.773(\text{Cb} - \delta).
  \end{array}
  \label{eq:iYCrCb}
\end{equation}
that in matrix form is
\begin{equation}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \text{R} \\
    \text{G} \\
    \text{B}
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1  &  1.403  & 0 \\ 
    1  &  -0.714  &  -0.344 \\ 
    1  & 0  & 1.773
  \end{bmatrix}
  %\cdot
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \text{Y} \\
    \text{Cr}-\delta \\
    \text{Cb}-\delta
  \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Quantization in the YCrCb domain}
The YCrCb transform is not orthogonal and the relative synthesis
filters gains depends on the energy of the inversely transformed
components. In this case, we can estimate the distortion generated by
the quantization of a color subband, always measured in the RGB
domain, if the rest of subbands are unquantized. This can be the
algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Variying the $\Delta$, estimate the RD curve for each YCrCb
  subband, keeping the other subbands unquantized. The distortion must
  be measures in the RGB domain.
\item Sort the RD points by their slope.
\item Apply progressively the combinations quantization steps. The
  distortion can be measure in both, the color-DCT and the RGB
  domains.
\end{enumerate}
See this \href{https://github.com/Sistemas-Multimedia/Sistemas-Multimedia.github.io/blob/master/study_guide/06-color_transform/YCrCb_compression.ipynb}{notebook}.

Notice that the only alternative to this ``fast'' rate-control
algorithm is to perform a brute-force search of quantization steps
combinations.

\begin{comment}
The synthesis filters gains are important because the quantization steps of each YCrCb component should be adjusted in order to effectively provide the desired number of \href{http://www.winlab.rutgers.edu/~crose/322_html/quantization.pdf}{bins} (different dequantized values) in each component.

The synthesis filters generates a gain of $||1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2||_2^2=3$
(square of the Euclidean norm) for the $\text{Y}$ component, $||1.402^2 + 0.714^2 +
0^2||_2^2=2.4754$ for the $\text{Cr}$ component, and $||0^2 + 0.344^2+
1.772^2||_2^2=3.25832$ for the $\text{Cb}$ component. So, when
compressing an image through quantization, the QSs should be modulated
accordinly (the higher the gain, the higher the quantization error,
and therefore, the smaller the QS should be).

\begin{comment}
\subsubsection{Quantization}
After analyzing the frame (representing it in the YCrCb domain), the
next natural step is quantization. Unfortunately, the RGB/YCrCb
transform is not orthogonal\footnote{The RGB/YCrCb is not orthogonal
because, for example, as we can see in the
Eq.~\ref{eq:YCrCb_analysis}, the value of Cr depends on the value of
Y, and therefore, there is a dependency between both
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra)}{basis}.}
and therefore the contribution of each channel to the quality of the
reconstructed image $\tilde{X}$ are not additive (this can be seen in
this
\href{https://github.com/Sistemas-Multimedia/Sistemas-Multimedia.github.io/blob/master/study_guide/06-color_transform/performance.ipynb}{notebook}). For
that reason, and only for the sake of simplicity, we will use
\begin{equation}
  \Delta_{\text{Y}} = \Delta_{\text{Cr}} = \Delta_{\text{Cb}}.
  \label{eq:simple_Q}
\end{equation}
\end{comment}

\begin{comment}
Lets suppose that we use a static
uniform dead-zone quantizer with QSs $\Delta_{\text{Y}}$,
$\Delta_{\text{Cr}}$, and $\Delta_{\text{Cb}}$, for the components Y,
Cr, and Cb, repectively. Lets suppose also that the RGB/YCrCb
transform is orthogonal\footnote{The RGB/YCrCb
  is not orthogonal because, for example, as we can see in the
  Eq.~\ref{eq:YCrCb_analysis}, the value of Cr depends on the value of
  Y, and therefore, there is a dependency between both
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra)}{basis}.},
that is, the filters of the analysis transform are orthogonal (that is
the same that the columns of the synthesis transform are orthogonal),
in order to assume that
\begin{equation}
  \Delta_{\text{Y}} = \Delta_{\text{Cr}} = \Delta_{\text{Cb}}.
  \label{eq:simple_Q}
\end{equation}
is a good quantization pattern. However, 

--------------

and under the
assumption of that the RGB/YCbCr is an
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality}{orthogonal}
transform and that each channel is compressed independently, the
optimal quantization of the channels should use $\Delta_{\text{Y}}$,
$\Delta_{\text{Cr}}$, and $\Delta_{\text{Cb}}$ so that
\begin{equation}
  \lambda_{\text{Y}} = \lambda_{\text{Cr}} = \lambda_{\text{Cb}},
  \label{eq:optimal_quantization}
\end{equation}
for a given total bit-rate $R$ (see this
\href{https://github.com/Sistemas-Multimedia/Sistemas-Multimedia.github.io/blob/master/study_guide/06-color_transform/performance.ipynb}{notebook})~\cite{vetterli1995wavelets,sayood2017introduction}. Therefore,
if all the channels have the same gain\footnote{The gain of a
transform can be determined computing the squared norm of the rows of
the synthesis transform (the synthesis filters).}, a quantization
strategy that should approximate Eq.~\ref{eq:optimal_quantization} is
to use
\begin{equation}
  \Delta_{\text{Y}} = \Delta_{\text{Cr}} = \Delta_{\text{Cb}}.
  \label{eq:simple_Q}
\end{equation}
When the gains are not the same, the quantization steps should be
divided\footnote{The squared norms measure the contribution of each
component to the energy of the pixel, and therefore, the higher the
contribution, the lower the $\Delta$.} by the channel gains, that for
the RGB/YCrCb transform are:
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{array}{rl}
    \text{Y}: & 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3\\
    \text{Cr}: & 1.402^2 + 0.714^2 = 2.4754\\
    \text{Cb}: & 0.344^2 + 1.772^2 = 3.25832
  \end{array}
\end{equation*}

% Si un coeficiente tiene una gran ganancia es implica que su
% quantization tambiÃ©n se dejarÃ¡ sentir mÃ¡s que si la ganancia es
% menor. Por tanto, tiene sentido usar un QS mayor en aquellos
% coeficientes de menor ganancia.

Unfortunately, the RGB/YCrCb transform is not orthogonal. This
means that the quantization noise introduced in one of the channel
will also affect to the rest of channels, which will degrade the RD
performance. The lack of orthogonality also reduces the effectivity of
the previous algorithm for determining the optimal quantization steps.

\end{comment}

\begin{comment}

After analyzing the frame (representing it in the YCrCb domain), the
next natural step is quantization. Supposing that we will use a static
uniform dead-zone quantizer with quantization steps
$\Delta_{\text{Y}}$, $\Delta_{\text{Cr}}$, and $\Delta_{\text{Cb}}$,
for the coefficients Y, Cr, and Cb, repectively, and supposing that
the contribution to the reconstruction of $X$ of one of the
coefficients is not influenced by the contribution of the rest of
coefficients (for this, both color spaces (RGB and YCrCb) should be
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality}{orthogonal}), the
optimal quantization steps $\Delta^*_{\text{Y}}$,
$\Delta^*_{\text{Cr}}$, and $\Delta^*_{\text{Cb}}$, can be found using
a constant slope
(\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate-distortion_theory}{RD}-$\lambda$)
quantization
strategy~\cite{vetterli1995wavelets,sayood2017introduction}.

As it can be seen in this
\href{https://github.com/Sistemas-Multimedia/Sistemas-Multimedia.github.io/blob/master/study_guide/06-color_transform/performance.ipynb}{notebook},
a RD (Rate-Distortion) curve is a 2D graph where we represent the
distortion generated by the quantization as a function of the bit-rate
of the quantization indexes. Thus, the closer the curve to the point
(0,0) of the graph, the better the performance of the encoding system
in RD terms. Now, if we suppose that each component (Y, Cr, and Cb) is
quantized and compressed independently, we can find the optimal
quantization steps, given a maximum target bit-rate $R^{\text{max}}$,
selecting them as
\begin{equation}
  \lambda_{\text{Y}} = \lambda_{\text{Cr}} = \lambda_{\text{Cb}},
\end{equation}
where $\lambda(R)$ is the slope of the RD curve for a given bit-rate
$R$, satisfiying also that
\begin{equation}
  R_{\text{Y}} + R_{\text{Cr}} + R_{\text{Cb}} \le R^{\text{max}}.
\end{equation}

Unfortunately, the RGB-to-YCrCb transform is not orthogonal (for
example, in Eq.~\ref{eq:YCrCb_analysis}, the value of Cr depends on the
value of Y, and therefore, there is a dependency between both
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra)}{basis})\footnote{This
can be also seen computing the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product}{inner product} of the
basis functions of the analysis transform (only the inner product of
orthogonal vectors is 0). Thus, for example, the product of the basis
functions for Y and Cr is $0.299\times 0.5+0.587\times (-0.4187) +
0.144\times (-0.0813) = -0.1055451$.} and therefore neither the RGB
and the YCrCb spaces. This dificults the finding of
$\Delta^*_{\text{Y}}$, $\Delta^*_{\text{Cr}}$, and
$\Delta^*_{\text{Cb}}$ because the quantization error generated in one
of the components influences the quantization error of the rest of
components, and when this happens, we cannot use CS-RS-QS.

Anyway, as you can see in this
\href{https://github.com/Sistemas-Multimedia/Sistemas-Multimedia.github.io/blob/master/study_guide/06-color_transform/performance.ipynb}{notebook},
the use of the YCrCb color domain can be beneficial, even using a
simple quantization strategy such as
\begin{equation}
  \Delta_{\text{Y}} = \Delta_{\text{Cr}} = \Delta_{\text{Cb}}.
\end{equation}
As it can be seen, the RD curves can be improved for most bit-rates,
and therefore, it can be an interesting tool for removing the
intercomponent redundancy from a pure mathematical point of view.

\subsection{The $\text{RGB} \Leftrightarrow \text{YCoCg}$ transform}
%\subsubsection{Analysis and synthesis}
Clearly, orthogonality is a desired property in lossy compression
systems because it helps to isolate\footnote{Without considering the
rest of components.} the impact (in the case of a color transform) of
each color subband on the quality of the reconstruction of the image,
simplifying significantly the determination of the pattern of QSs that
generate the optimal RD curve.

Moreover, Eqs.~\ref{eq:YCrCb} and \ref{eq:iYCrCb} were derived by
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis}{Principal
  Component Analysis (PCA)} on old\footnote{Recorded with the first
analog color cameras in the 70's.} video data. The same procedure has
been carried out with newer\footnote{\cite{malvar2008lifting} is dated
in 2008.} images, obtaining
\begin{equation}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \text{Y} \\
    \text{C}_1 \\
    \text{C}_2
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3} &  \frac{1}{3} \\ 
    \frac{1}{2} &           0 & -\frac{1}{2} \\
   -\frac{1}{4} & \frac{1}{2} & -\frac{1}{4}
  \end{bmatrix}
  %\cdot
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \text{R} \\
    \text{G} \\
    \text{B}
  \end{bmatrix}
  \Leftrightarrow
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \text{R} \\
    \text{G} \\
    \text{B}
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1  &  1  & -\frac{2}{3} \\ 
    1  &  0  &  \frac{4}{3} \\ 
    1  & -1  & -\frac{2}{3}
  \end{bmatrix}
  %\cdot
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \text{Y} \\
    \text{C}_1 \\
    \text{C}_2
  \end{bmatrix}.
  \label{eq:optimal}
\end{equation}

The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCoCg}{YCoCg} color transform
is orthogonal and the synthesis filters gains\footnote{The gain of a
transform can be determined computing the squared norm of the rows of
the synthesis transform (the synthesis filters).} are 22/9 (for
$\text{Y}$), 25/9 (for $\text{C}_1$) and 22/9 (for $\text{C}_2$).

Unfortunately, from a perceptual perspective we must impose (thinking
of the subsampling of the chromas) some features in a color transform
(such as the influence of the green channel on the luma channel should
be high) that violates the orthogonality constrain
\cite{malvar2008lifting}. For this reason the authors finally propose
the transform
\begin{equation}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \text{Y} \\
    \text{Co} \\
    \text{Cg}
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{1}{4} &  \frac{1}{2}  &  \frac{1}{4} \\ 
    \frac{1}{2} &            0  & -\frac{1}{2} \\
    -\frac{1}{4} &  \frac{1}{2}  & -\frac{1}{4}
  \end{bmatrix}
  %\cdot
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \text{R} \\
    \text{G} \\
    \text{B}
  \end{bmatrix}
  \Leftrightarrow
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \text{R} \\
    \text{G} \\
    \text{B}
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1  &  1  & -1 \\ 
    1  &  0  &  1 \\ 
    1  & -1  & -1
  \end{bmatrix}
  %\cdot
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \text{Y} \\
    \text{Co} \\
    \text{Cg}
  \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
that is near orthogonal\footnote{For example, $\frac{1}{4}\frac{-1}{4}
+ \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4}\frac{-1}{4} = \frac{1}{8}$, and
we should obtain always 0.}, and has channel gains 3 ($\text{Y}$), 2
($\text{Co}$) and 3 ($\text{Cg}$). %These gains suggest that

Again, notice that if the $\text{RGB}$ values ranges between $0$
and $255$ (and rounding to the nearest integer), $0\le\text{Y}\le 255$,
$-128\le\text{Co}\le 127$ and $-128\le\text{Cg}\le 127$, and
therefore, the number of bits that are necessary to represent each
component is $8$. Therefore, we can use the same QS range for each
component. See this \href{https://github.com/Sistemas-Multimedia/Sistemas-Multimedia.github.io/blob/master/milestones/06-YUV_compression/YCrCb_matrix.ipynb}{notebook}.

\subsubsection{Quantization in the YCoCg domain}
Again, like in the color-DCT, ignoring the possible effects of the
entropy encoding stage (that could compress more some color subbands),
the previous gains suggest to use
\begin{equation}
  \frac{3}{2}\Delta_{\text{Y}} = \Delta_{\text{Co}} = \frac{3}{2}\Delta_{\text{Cg}}.
\end{equation}
See this \href{https://github.com/Sistemas-Multimedia/Sistemas-Multimedia.github.io/blob/master/milestones/06-YUV_compression/YCrCb_matrix.ipynb}{notebook}.

If the RD slope of each point depends also on the performance of DEFLATE (something that is normal), we can find the optimal RD curve with the algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Varilling the $\Delta$, estimate (remember that YCoCg is only  near-orthonal), the RD curve of each YCoCg subband can de found (without considering the rest of subbands).
\item Sort the RD points by their slope.
\item Apply progressively the combinations of quantization
  steps. Measure the distortion in the RGB domain (in the transform
  domain could be only estimated).
\end{enumerate}
