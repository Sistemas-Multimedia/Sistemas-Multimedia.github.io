\section{What is perceptual coding?}

Deadzone quantization: change signal and electronic noise by
quantization noise, where the SNR is very small.

\section{Loop filters}
Use for example in H.264

\section{Quantization in the $\texttt{RGB}$ domain}

The color-recognition accuracy of the HVS is
finite~\cite{vruiz__visual_redundancy}. For this reason, quantization
in the $\texttt{RGB}$ color space can be imperceptible.

any alternative different from
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{\Delta}^{\text{R}}_i = \mathbf{\Delta}^{\text{G}}_i =
  \mathbf{\Delta}^{\text{B}}_i,
  \label{eq:simple_Q}
\end{equation}
where $i$ represents the $i$-th quantization step size, will produce
some alteration in the color\footnote{We consider here color as a
whole, not only the chroma.}

\section{Chroma redundancy}

Humans do not perceive detail in the chrominance as well as in they
does in the
luminance.~\cite{burger2016digital}. As in
$\text{YCrCb}$, the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)}{sampling
  rate} of the chroma is usually reduces to 1/4 without any noticeable
distortion. This feature is used in some of the last image and video
compression systems such as
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_XR#Description}{JPEG XR} and
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding#Video_coding_layer}{HEVC}.

\section{Redundancy in the RGB domain}

The Human Visual System (HVS) is more sensitive to luminance than to
chrominance~\cite{vruiz__visual_redundancy}. This basically means that
we can an encoding process we modify the color information of an image
or a video without noticing a high distortion.

Since the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system}{HVS
  (Human Visual System)} is not able to perceive detail in the
chrominance as well as it does in the luminance, the amount of
information, and consequently
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)}{sampling
  rate}, used in the chrominance can be generally reduced to 1/4 of
the used for the luminance without a noticeable distortion (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:san-diego_chroma_subsampled})~\cite{burger2016digital}. This
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)}{fact is
  used when compressing} digital still images and is one of the reason
why, for example, the $\text{YCrCb}$ transform is used in the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG}{JPEG} image compressor.
