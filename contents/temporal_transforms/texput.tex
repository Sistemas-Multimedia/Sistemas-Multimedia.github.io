\section{Temporal correlation}
%{{{

In general, neighbour \emph{frames} (images) in (video)
\emph{sequences} exhibit a high temporal correlation that can be
exploited to increase the compression ratios. This correlation
generates a temporal redundancy that can be removed using a temporal
transformation.

A temporal transform inputs two o more frames\footnote{With pixels or
  coefficients, depending on the current domain of the frame. Notice,
  for example, that if the frame is in the DWT domain, we should refer
  to it as a ``decomposition'' instead of as a ``frame''.}, and
outputs at least one \emph{residual} (frame) in which the residual
pixels have a higher dynamic range but also a smaller entropy. This
potentially increases the compression ratios (in the case of video,
usually measures in kbps)..

%}}}

\section{Motion Compensation (MC)}
%{{{

Most video coding standards use
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_compensation}{Motion
  Compensation (MC)} to generate the residual
frames~\cite{vruiz__MC}. Therefore, MC exploits the temporal
correlation and reduce the entropy of the residuals\footnote{The
  better the prediction, the lower the entropy of the
  residuals.}. Basically, MC consists in substracting to each original
frame a prediction (frame) build with the information that must be
also avaliable\footnote{In order to make a reversible process.} at the
decoder. Notice that, after using MC, the number of residual-pixels is
equal to the number of pixels in the compensated frame.\footnote{At
  least, when we compensate in the image domain.}

%}}}

\section{Motion Estimation (ME)}
%{{{

To compensate the motion we need first to estimate
it~\cite{vruiz__ME}. Using the motion fiels generated by the motion
estimator, both the encoder and the decoder generate the predictions
that will de substracted (added in the case of the decoder) from the
predicted images~\cite{vruiz__MC}.

\section{GOF-ing}

The RD performance of ME/MC depends on the amount of temporal
redundancy in the sequence. If such amount is low, it can be more
RD-efficient to interrupt the MC process. The set of consecutive
frames in which MC is active is usually known as a GOF\footnote{Some
  standards also use GOP (Group Of Pictures).} (Group of
Frames). Notice that (under the RD prism) the length of the GOFs is
variable and therefore, the GOF partition should be an adaptive
process.

However, in some contexts\footnote{Specifically, constant bit-rate
  systems.} it can be necessary to use a fixed GOP partition (see the
Section~\ref{sec:random}).

\section{Block-based MC}

The MC schemes used in most video coding standards compensate blocks
of pixels. In this context, depending of the block decision mode
implemented in the RDO procedure\footnote{Obviously, the part of the
  RDO procedure that controls the block-type.}, blocks can be of
different type (I (intra), P (predicted), B
(bidirectionally-predicted) and S (skipped))~\cite{vruiz__MC}.
